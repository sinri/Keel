and modified to be fit in Keel, including reimplemented Base32 Encoding.

> GoogleAuth is a Java server library that implements the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in RFC
6238.
>
> This implementation borrows from Google Authenticator, whose C code has served as a reference, and was created upon
> code published in this blog post by Enrico M. Crisostomo.
